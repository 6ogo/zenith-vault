# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

This project is about developing an all-in-one online digital business platform that helps organizations manage every aspect of the customer lifecycle. From sales and customer service to marketing and website development, the platform brings together key business functions in one central hub. By integrating modern AI—specifically GPT-4o—for predictive insights and task automation, the platform not only saves time but also enhances decision-making, ensuring that every step of the customer journey is efficient and data-driven.

The platform is being built to give businesses a streamlined, scalable, and secure solution for handling operations. The core objectives are to simplify complex business processes, provide tailored dashboards for various user roles (like admin, sales, customer service, and marketing), and deliver seamless integrations with tools like Stripe for payments and Supabase for backend services. Success will be measured by its ease of use, reduced manual workload through automation, high data security with encryption and role-based access, and its ability to integrate with additional third-party systems.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   **Sales Management:** Tools to track leads, manage pipelines, automate follow-ups, and offer sales forecasting insights.
*   **Customer Service:** A dedicated module featuring support case management, self-service knowledge bases, and AI-driven chatbots and sentiment analysis.
*   **Marketing Automation:** Features for creating and managing personalized campaigns across email and social media, including real-time engagement tracking and predictive content suggestions.
*   **Customer Data Management:** A centralized database for customer contact details, purchase histories, and communication logs with strict access controls.
*   **Website Development and Hosting:** Both pre-built templates for non-technical users and full customization options (via a drag-and-drop visual builder or code editor) for advanced users.
*   **Integration and Analytics:** Seamless data integrations with external CRMs, ERP systems, email marketing tools, and social media platforms, alongside comprehensive reporting and analytics tools.
*   **AI and Automation:** Utilization of GPT-4o to automate tasks such as lead scoring, follow-ups, content generation, and sentiment analysis.
*   **Role-Based Access and Security:** Implementation of RBAC with end-to-end encryption, two-factor authentication, and routine security audits.
*   **Payment Processing:** Integration with Stripe for handling both subscriptions and one-time transactions.
*   **Multi-Language Support:** Interface available in English, Spanish, Mandarin, and Swedish.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Building integrations with every possible third-party tool by default; only common ones (e.g., Mailchimp/SendGrid for email, Salesforce/HubSpot for CRM, SAP/NetSuite for ERP) will be targeted initially.
*   Fully customized AI models beyond GPT-4o for this version; additional AI modules or models like Claude will be considered for subsequent phases.
*   Advanced support for extremely niche pricing models other than subscriptions, one-time transactions, or usage-based billing at launch.
*   Deep-dive customizations for industries not specified in the pre-built template collection. These can be added later as custom development requests.

## 3. User Flow

When a new user lands on the platform, they first encounter a secure login screen featuring role-based registration and two-factor authentication for enhanced security. The initial onboarding flow introduces users to the dashboard, explaining how to navigate between key modules like Sales, Customer Service, Marketing, and Website Development. The system tailors the information presented depending on whether the user is an admin, sales representative, customer service agent, or marketing manager, ensuring each sees the data most relevant to their responsibilities.

After signing in, users are directed to a centralized dashboard where they can see real-time metrics, upcoming tasks, and automated reports. From this home screen, a left-hand navigation menu allows quick access to specific modules and functionalities—such as reviewing lead statuses in the Sales Module, handling support tickets in the Customer Service Center, or launching and tracking campaigns in the Marketing Hub. In addition, users with website administration privileges can access tools for website development, choosing from pre-built templates or opting for full customization via low-code and pro-code environments.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   **Constraints:**

    *   Reliance on GPT-4o for core AI functionalities; its availability and performance are assumed as per OpenAI’s standards.
    *   Supabase is used for database, authentication, and storage, so its limitations or outages can affect the platform.
    *   Stripe integration assumes adherence to their API guidelines for payment processing.
    *   Hosting on Vercel and backend on Supabase, which may impose certain usage limits or pricing tiers.

*   **Assumptions:**

    *   The target users are businesses that handle a considerable volume of customer data and require advanced security measures.
    *   The platform is expected to integrate with popular third-party tools (e.g., Mailchimp, Salesforce) with future scaling in mind.
    *   Users will have varied technical expertise, which is why both low-code and pro-code website development options are provided.
    *   Pre-built templates will cover common industries while allowing further customization as needed.
    *   Regular updates and maintenance will be scheduled to meet evolving security and functionality standards.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **Integration Challenges:**

    *   Integrating with multiple external systems (e.g., CRMs, ERP tools) may introduce complications such as API rate limits or data synchronization issues. A clear strategy using webhooks, custom API connectors, or middleware (like Zapier) is recommended.

*   **Performance Bottlenecks:**

    *   Real-time dashboards and AI-driven automation might impose heavy loads. Mitigation strategies include using server-side caching, incremental static regeneration in Next.js, and optimizing database queries on Supabase.

*   **Security & Compliance Risks:**

    *   Maintaining multi-layer security (end-to-end encryption, RBAC, 2FA) across diverse modules is complex. Regular security audits and automated monitoring must be in place to promptly detect and patch vulnerabilities.

*   **User Experience Complexity:**

    *   Balancing rich functionalities for advanced users with simplicity for non-technical users can be challenging. Iterative user testing and adopting responsive design principles will help reduce potential usability issues.

*   **AI Reliability:**

    *   Dependence on GPT-4o for numerous automation tasks may lead to issues if the service experiences downtime or unpredictable performance. It is advisable to include fallback mechanisms or manual override options for critical business functions.
