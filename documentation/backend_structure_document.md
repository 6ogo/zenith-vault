# Backend Structure Document

This document offers a clear and simple overview of the backend architecture of our online digital business platform. It is designed so that both technical and non-technical readers can understand the complete setup and how each component works to support a secure, scalable, and performant solution.

## 1. Backend Architecture

Our backend is primarily built using Supabase, a managed service that provides a powerful PostgreSQL database, authentication, and storage. Here’s an outline of the backend architecture:

*   **Modular, Service-Driven Structure:**

    *   All backend operations are centralized in Supabase, ensuring interactions are streamlined and consistent.
    *   A RESTful API model is employed using Supabase’s PostgREST, making it easier for other parts of our platform (like our Next.js frontend) to communicate with the backend.

*   **Key Design Patterns & Frameworks:**

    *   **Separation of Concerns:** Authentication, database operations, and storage are separated out to dedicated modules within Supabase.

    *   **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):** Different user roles such as admin, sales rep, customer service, and marketing manager have tailored access

    *   **Scalability & Performance:**

        *   Supabase’s global edge network and automated scaling ensure that as our platform grows, performance remains optimal.
        *   Integration with Vercel’s CDN for rapid content delivery enhances both speed and user experience.

*   **Integration Points:**

    *   Payment Processing with Stripe
    *   AI & Automation through GPT-4o and other AI tools
    *   Third-party integrations for email, CRM, ERP, and analytics

## 2. Database Management

The platform uses Supabase’s PostgreSQL as its database with modern data management practices:

*   **Technologies Used:**

    *   **Database System:** PostgreSQL (provided by Supabase)
    *   **Authentication & Authorization:** Managed through Supabase Authentication using RBAC
    *   **Cloud Storage:** Managed via Supabase Storage, with automated backups and export options (e.g., to S3)

*   **Data Structure & Access:**

    *   Data is organized into logical tables corresponding to key business functions (users, sales, customer service, marketing, payments, website templates, etc.).
    *   Supabase’s built-in security and edge network allow secure and rapid access to the data.
    *   Automated backups ensure that data is consistently protected and can be restored in case any issues arise.

## 3. Database Schema

The adoption of PostgreSQL means our data schema is structured and relational. Here’s a human-readable explanation:

*   **Users Table:** Contains basic user information, roles, and permissions (admin, sales rep, etc.).
*   **Sales Table:** Houses records of leads, pipelines, and transactions following sales activities.
*   **Customer_Service Table:** Manages tickets, chat logs, and sentiment analysis data.
*   **Marketing Table:** Stores campaign data, customer segmentation details, and campaign performance metrics.
*   **Website_Templates & Customization:** Maintains details of pre-built templates and customization projects for our website development module.
*   **Payments Table:** Logs transactions, subscription details, and billing information via Stripe.
*   **Integrations Table:** Tracks connections to third-party systems like Mailchimp, Salesforce, and Google Analytics.

Below is an example of an SQL schema snippet for our core tables:

-- Users Table CREATE TABLE users ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL, password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- e.g., admin, sales, customer_service, marketing created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );

-- Sales Table CREATE TABLE sales ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id), lead_details TEXT, status VARCHAR(50), created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );

-- Customer Service Table CREATE TABLE customer_service ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id), ticket_number VARCHAR(255), issue TEXT, status VARCHAR(50), created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );

## -- Payments Table CREATE TABLE payments ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id), transaction_id VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE, amount DECIMAL(10,2), payment_type VARCHAR(50), created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );

## 4. API Design and Endpoints

Our APIs use a RESTful approach, largely generated and maintained by Supabase, with endpoints exposed securely for the frontend to consume.

*   **Key API Endpoints Include:**

    *   **Authentication:**

        *   Endpoint for login, signup, and 2FA verification
        *   Endpoint to manage password resets and role validation

    *   **Sales Module:**

        *   Endpoints to create, update, and fetch sales leads and pipeline information
        *   Integration endpoint for AI-powered insights (e.g., lead scoring)

    *   **Customer Service Module:**

        *   API for logging customer inquiries, managing tickets, and retrieving past interactions

    *   **Marketing and Analytics:**

        *   Endpoints that deliver campaign data, run segmentation analysis, and provide real-time dashboards

    *   **Payments Processing:**

        *   Endpoints for initiating Stripe-based transactions for subscriptions, one-time payments, and usage-based billing

    *   **Integration Endpoints:**

        *   Secure endpoints to connect with external systems like Mailchimp, Salesforce, and Google Analytics

## 5. Hosting Solutions

The platform leverages modern cloud hosting to ensure reliability and performance:

*   **Vercel:**

    *   Hosts the Next.js frontend, offering robust performance through a global CDN.
    *   Vercel’s seamless integration improves update cycles and rollbacks.

*   **Supabase:**

    *   Hosts the backend database, authentication, and storage components.
    *   Benefits include automatic scaling, global edge presence, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.

## 6. Infrastructure Components

Several infrastructure components work together to ensure smooth and secure performance:

*   **Load Balancers:** Automatically distribute network traffic for high availability and optimal performance.
*   **Caching Mechanisms:** Utilized within Supabase and through Vercel’s CDN to speed up data retrieval and page loads.
*   **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Vercel’s CDN ensures all frontend assets are served from locations closest to users worldwide.
*   **Edge Networks:** Supabase’s global edge network ensures low-latency database interactions and secure data access.

## 7. Security Measures

Security is at the heart of the platform. Robust measures and regular audits ensure data integrity and compliance:

*   **Data Encryption:** End-to-end encryption is on by default, ensuring that the data in transit and at rest remains secure.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Enhances login security.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Fine-grained permissions managed by Supabase ensure that users only access the data permitted for their role.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Frequent reviews and testing to identify vulnerabilities.
*   **Compliance Standards:** The platform is designed to comply with GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, and other relevant regulations.

## 8. Monitoring and Maintenance

We continuously monitor the platform to ensure any issues are identified and resolved rapidly:

*   **Monitoring Tools:**

    *   Supabase provides built-in monitoring for database performance and uptime.
    *   Vercel offers monitoring tools and logs for the frontend.

*   **Maintenance Practices:**

    *   Automated backups are in place using Supabase; these backups can also be exported to S3 as needed.
    *   Regular software updates, security patches, and system audits ensure long-term reliability.

## 9. Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

In summary, the backend of our digital business platform is designed to be robust, secure, and scalable. By combining the strengths of Supabase for backend services with Vercel for frontend content delivery, we achieve:

*   **Reliable and Swift Performance:** Thanks to global edge networks and CDNs.
