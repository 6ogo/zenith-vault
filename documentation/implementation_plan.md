# Implementation plan

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

1.  Install Node.js v20.2.1 on your development machine to ensure compatibility with Next.js 14. (**Tech Stack: Frontend**)
2.  Verify Node.js installation by running `node -v` in your terminal. (**Tech Stack: Frontend**)
3.  Create a new Git repository for the project. (**Project Overview**)
4.  Initialize the project using the Next.js 14 starter template with TypeScript by running: `npx create-next-app@14 --ts --experimental-app` This ensures you are using Next.js 14 as specified. (**Tech Stack: Frontend**)
5.  Set up Tailwind CSS by following the Tailwind installation guide and configuring your project to use TypeScript. Create the configuration file at `tailwind.config.js` and add the paths to your files. (**Tech Stack: Frontend / Branding Guidelines**)
6.  Install shadcn UI components per documentation and configure them for use with Tailwind CSS. (**Tech Stack: Frontend**)
7.  Create project directory structure with folders such as `/src/components`, `/src/pages`, and `/src/styles`. (**Project Overview**)
8.  **Validation**: Verify project setup by running `npm run dev` and ensuring the Next.js app starts without errors. (**Tech Stack: Frontend**)

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

1.  Create a main dashboard page at `/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` that will serve as the central landing page after login. (**Project Overview: Sales Management, Customer Service, Marketing Automation**)

2.  Develop a login page at `/src/app/login/page.tsx` with email and password inputs, ensuring form validation rules are applied. (**Project Overview; Branding Guidelines for typography and color**)

3.  Style all pages using Tailwind CSS classes with brand colors:

    *   Primary Color: Deep Blue (#003366) for headers and primary buttons
    *   Accent Color: Bright Green (#00CC66) for highlights
    *   Background Color: Light Gray (#F0F0F0) for backgrounds
    *   Text Color: Dark Gray (#333333) for body text (**Branding Guidelines**)

4.  Integrate multi-language support using next-intl by installing it and configuring locales for English, Spanish, Mandarin, and Swedish. (**Multi-Language Support**)

5.  Set up client-side routing with Next.js App Router between pages (e.g., login, dashboard, website builder). (**Tech Stack: Frontend**)

6.  Create a navigation component at `/src/components/Navbar.tsx` using shadcn components to follow flat design aesthetics. (**Branding Guidelines**)

7.  **Validation**: Run `npm run dev` and test navigation and form validations in the browser, verifying that UI components render correctly. (**Tech Stack: Frontend**)

## Phase 3: Backend Development

1.  Set up Supabase for database, authentication, and storage by creating a new Supabase project and note down the API keys and connection settings. (**Tech Stack: Backend & Storage**)

2.  Configure Supabase client in your Next.js app by creating `/src/lib/supabaseClient.ts` that initializes the client with your project’s URL and API key. (**Tech Stack: Backend & Storage**)

3.  Configure Supabase authentication with role-based access control (RBAC) and enable row-level security. Set this up through Supabase’s dashboard. (**User Roles and Permissions**)

4.  Implement two-factor authentication (2FA) using Supabase’s MFA options. Document necessary settings in the project README. (**User Roles and Permissions**)

5.  Create API routes in Next.js under `/src/pages/api` for key backend operations:

    *   `/api/sales` for sales management operations (lead tracking, pipeline updates)
    *   `/api/services` for customer service inquiries and support cases
    *   `/api/marketing` for campaign automation tasks (**Project Overview: Core Features**)

6.  Develop Stripe payment processing endpoints in an API route at `/src/pages/api/stripe/charge.ts` for handling subscriptions, one-time payments, and usage-based billing. (**Payment Processing Details**)

7.  **Validation**: Test each API endpoint using tools like Postman or curl to ensure a response is received (expect HTTP 200 responses for valid requests). (**Project Overview; Payment Processing Details**)

## Phase 4: Integration

1.  Integrate the frontend with Supabase by using the client you set up in `/src/lib/supabaseClient.ts` to handle authentication and data fetching. (**Tech Stack: Backend & Storage**)
2.  Connect UI components (e.g., login form and dashboard) to the respective Supabase API calls. For example, in `/src/app/login/page.tsx`, add logic to authenticate users via Supabase. (**Project Overview: Customer Data Management**)
3.  Integrate Stripe payment processing by linking your payment form to the `/api/stripe/charge.ts` endpoint using fetch or axios in a dedicated service file at `/src/services/paymentService.ts`. (**Payment Processing Details**)
4.  Implement integration with third-party services for email marketing (Mailchimp, SendGrid), CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot), and ERPs (SAP, NetSuite) within individual API routes or serverless functions. (**Third-Party Integrations**)
5.  Connect real-time analytics and dashboard components on the frontend to the backend analytics endpoints, enabling data visualization similar to Power BI. (**Analytics and Reporting**)
6.  **Validation**: Conduct end-to-end testing by simulating user workflows (login, payment, data fetching) and verify data updates in Supabase and responses from third-party integrations. (**Project Overview**)

## Phase 5: Deployment

1.  Deploy the Next.js frontend to Vercel by pushing your repository and linking it to a new project on Vercel. Set up the project to use the production branch. (**Deployment and Hosting**)
2.  Configure environment variables on Vercel for Supabase URL, Supabase API Key, and Stripe API keys using Vercel’s dashboard under the designated environment settings. (**Deployment and Hosting**)
3.  Configure Supabase project settings (including automated backups and global edge network settings) in the Supabase dashboard. (**Deployment and Hosting**)
4.  Set up a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline that runs tests, linting, and builds the Next.js app before deployment. Use Vercel’s built-in CI/CD for deployment automation. (**Deployment and Hosting**)
5.  **Validation**: After deployment, run end-to-end tests (using tools such as Cypress) on the production URL to verify that all features work as expected (authentication, payments, API calls, multi-language support). (**Deployment and Hosting**)

## Additional Tooling for Code Assistance and Automation

1.  Integrate code generation tools as part of your developer workflow:

    *   Use Lovable for code scaffolding and common component generation.
    *   Utilize Windsurf as an IDE plugin for context-based assistance while coding.
    *   Consult GPT-4o and Claude (versions 3.7 Sonnet and 3.5 Sonnet) for complex logic generation and code review. (**Tools**)

2.  Document integration instructions, API details, and interaction flows with these tools in a developer guide in the project’s `/docs` folder. (**Tools**)

3.  **Validation**: Verify that the code assistance tools correctly integrate with your development environment by generating a sample component and reviewing its output.

This completes the high-level step-by-step implementation plan for the digital business platform. Follow each step carefully to ensure all requirements—from UI design to backend integrations and deployment—are met as specified in the project details.
